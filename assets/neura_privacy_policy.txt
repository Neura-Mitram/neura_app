Neura Privacy Policy
=====================

Last Updated: July 25, 2025

At Neura, your privacy and safety are our top priorities. This privacy policy explains what data we collect, why we collect it, and how we use it within the Neura app.

1. Information We Collect
--------------------------

Neura collects only the data required to provide you with a personalized and safe AI assistant experience:

- **Microphone Access**: We use your microphone to stream your voice for real-time interaction. Audio is processed securely and never stored without your explicit consent.
- **Location Access**: Used for SOS support, travel tips, and local context. Your location data is never shared or sold.
- **Battery Optimization Access**: Required to keep the assistant responsive even when your phone is idle.
- **Overlay Permission**: Used to show a floating dot or message while Neura listens or speaks, helping you stay in control.
- **Usage Access Permission**: Allows Neura to detect which app you're using (e.g., Gmail, Spotify) to offer context-aware support. We only log app name, and never usage frequency or app content.

2. How We Use Your Data
------------------------

- To personalize voice replies based on emotion and context.
- To trigger helpful nudges or reminders.
- To power the wakeword and ambient assistant features.
- To ensure continuous and proactive support (with user consent).

3. What We Don’t Do
--------------------

- We do **not** record or store your audio.
- We do **not** track your app usage frequency or screen time.
- We do **not** show ads or sell your data to third parties.

4. Data Retention
------------------

We retain only the data necessary to deliver your experience. All voice streams are ephemeral and discarded after the interaction ends.

Additionally, all stored data — such as mood logs, journal entries, or goals — are automatically deleted based on your tier. This ranges from **7 days to 180 days**, depending on your account level, to ensure privacy by design.

You can delete your preferences or stored data at any time from the app.

5. Security & Transparency
---------------------------

We use **end-to-end encryption** to secure all sensitive data, including voice interactions and personal logs.

Your data is stored in a highly secure PostgreSQL database hosted on **Amazon AWS infrastructure**, with strict access controls.

Neura is committed to transparency — our core assistant logic and integrations are available via open-source platforms on **Hugging Face**, **GitHub**, and more.

- You can disable ambient tracking or voice streaming from the app settings.
- You can view, modify, or delete your profile data at any time.
